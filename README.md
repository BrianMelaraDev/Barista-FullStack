# Game of Thrones API
This Full-Stack Application saves your favorite Game of Thrones Characters if you log in. Users are able to enter a character from the show and retreive the real actor that plays that character and the location where they're from in the show. I am using an API to fetch the actor names based on the character the user inputs all in the server side.
