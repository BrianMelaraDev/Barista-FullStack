# Barista FullStack
This is my Barista FullStack application. It allows user to input an order and attach a name to that order. Then the Barista can login and coomplete the orders which will move to the completed section. Then they may choose to delete orders as they complete. I am saving the users data into my database in MongoDB and using the module Mongoose in Node.js I was able to include some CRUD functionality by saving the users data and updating the list as it goes.

# What I Learned
I learned how to save user data in MongoDB with the Mongoose module, and allow only Baristas to edit the lists using the same ejs file as the client .
